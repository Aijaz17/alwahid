                <p>This is not just a mosque for prayers rather it is a community center of all. The center is committed
                    to preserving an Islamic identity.</p>
                <p>Muslim community, promoting acomprehensive Islamic way of life based on the Holly Quran and the
                    Sunnah of Prophet Mohammad (SAWW).According to Islamic Scholars , the first revelation of Al Quran began in 22nd December 609AD till
                    632AD , a total of 23 years . The revelations began in the Cave of Hira , on the top of
                    Jabal-ul-Noor , near Makkah.it is noted that the first revelation of the Quran began when Angel Jibreel ordered Prophet Muhammed
                    (PBUH) to "read" , but was replied "no" . This happened 2 times after which Jibreel revealed the
                    first 5 ayaat of Surat-ul-Alaq. In turn , Rasoolullah (SAW) taught his people the verses he
                    received.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="vk-text">
                <p>The suwar of the Al Quran that was revealed before to the Hijrah was known as suwar Makkiyyah,
                    according to Al Quranic scholars. There are 114 suwars in all, including 87 suwars in Makkiyyah and 27 in
                    Madaniyyah. Suwar is the plural form of "surah," which denotes a chapter of the Al Quran. In turn , Rasoolullah (SAW) taught his
                    people the verses he received as soon as he learned them . Once he taught the people the verses , he
                    told them to put it in action in their daily life.
                    The Sahabahs were instructed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to transcribe the Ayahs onto objects like
                    bones and wood. The majority of the sahabah were illiterate, thus they were instructed to study the
                    basic writing of the day from the prisoners of war. As a result, a group of sahabah acquired
                    literacy through time.

                <p>Some of the scribes who wrote down the Quran include Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqqas, Ubayy Ibn Ka'b, and Zaid
                    Ibn Thabet. soon after Muhammad's demise. Abu Bakr, the caliph, made the decision to compile the
                    various verses and chapters into a single book. As a result, many handwritten copies of the entire
                    book were created by a group of reciters, including Zayd ibn Thabit. The third caliph Uthman ibn
                    Affan ordered the creation of an official, standardized edition of the Al Quran and was distributed
                    to these important Muslim cities in about 650, as Islam began to spread outside of the Arabian
                    Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa.
                    After the Prophet Muhammad passed away, the Khaleefah of Abu Baker gathered the original text of the
                    Al Quran, which was later reproduced and distributed by the Khaleefah Uthman Ibn Affan.
